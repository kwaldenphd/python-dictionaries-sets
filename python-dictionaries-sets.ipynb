    "## Lab Objectives\n",
    "- Define dictionaries in the Python programming language\n",
    "- Practice utilizing dictionaries and sets in the Python programming language\n",
    "  * For dictionaries, this includes basic syntax, ordering, adding key-value pairs, updating, lists, and iteration\n",
    "  * For sets, this includes basic syntax, adding and removing, and testing for membership\n",
    "- Use Python methods and functions to work with dictionaries and sets\n",
